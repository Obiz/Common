# Obiz\Common [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Obiz/Common.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/Obiz/Common?branch=develop)

Common Library created by Obiz team to support general PHP projects

---

This project was created with the effort of providing a more robust, secure and
testable environment for general PHP projects, mainly written on top of the most
used open-source CMS/CMF tools, such as [Drupal](http://drupal.org/),
[Magento](http://magentocommerce.com), [Joomla](http://joomla.org) and others.
It is based on/built on top of lots of different well-known projects, like
[Symfony](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) and
[Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/). Basically, Obiz\Common provides
an full environment to work with some concepts, such as Entities, Collections,
 Repositories, Entity Managers, Strategy Providers and other kinds of abstraction
tools.
